In the vanilla game there is no rain or fog. Although there is snow, it does not have variable density and it does not affect combat.

This mod adds rain, snow and fog with variable density to campaign and custom battle missions. Rain and snow decrease movement speed, projectile speed and morale. Fog decreases AI shoot frequency and morale. Dust storms decrease movement speed, projectile speed, AI shoot frequency and morale.

In campaign missions the chance of rain/snow and fog are 10% by default and the density of rain/snow and fog are random. The chance of dust storms in deserts is 10%. The chance of rain/snow increases to 20% in forests. The chance of fog increases to 20% near rivers. The chance of rain/snow and fog decrease to 5% in steppes and 1% in deserts. Rain in deserts will be very heavy.

In custom battles you can select the rain/snow and fog density from none, light, moderate, heavy and very heavy. You can select dust storms as a special option under the fog density dropdown.

If you are using Realistic Battle Mod, rain, snow and dust storms also increase the drain rate of posture.

There is an intermittent crash where there is supposedly rain in a scene but the rain prefab entity cannot be found in order to modify it. Unfortunately the only workaround I could think of was not to modify the rain. This may cause a weird situation where there will be rain effects on speed and morale etc but there is no visible rain and the sky does not look overcast. If you encounter this please take a screenshot and report it to me!

Make sure that you are using the correct versions of the mod and its requirements for your game build!

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
